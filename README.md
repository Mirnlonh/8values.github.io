The 8values Political Quiz measures individuals' political values, including Equality, Might, Liberty, Tradition, Wealth, Peace, Authority, and Progress.
The aim of the fork is to provide additional features to the 8values Political Quiz, including but not limited to translation (e.g. FIGS translation, different values for comparison, graphics, etc.). Currently it's WIP.
